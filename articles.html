            <h1 class="title">ECMAscript</h1>
            <h5>What is ECMAscript?</h5>
            <p>
                ECMAscript actually is the primary language that Javascript is based on. Digging into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">Javascript</a> you can see that Javascript is listed as a major implementation of ECMAscript.
                So Javascript actually comes from ECMAscript. ECMAscript is a standardized specification of JavaScript, developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape; Originally it was called
                Mocha, followed by LiveScript and then eventually settling as Javascript. So to break it down into simple terms Javascript is basically ECMAscript at its core, but builds upon it.
                other scripting languages like JScript, and ActionScript, all use ECMAscript as its core as well. A good real world comparison would be the three scripting languages previously stated
                are all diffrent cars but run on the same motor (ECMAscript).
            </p>
            <p>
                The first edition of ECMA-262 was adopted by the Ecma General Assembley in June of 1997. The name "ECMAscript" was introduced by the organizations involved with standardizing the language,
                (Netscape & Microsoft). A little funny thing to mention is that Brendan Eich commented that "EchmaScript was always an unwanted trade name that sounds like a skin disease."
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently there are 10 different versions of ECMA-262. Work on the 10th version was finalized in June of 2019, leading to ES.Next which is a dynamic name that refers to whatever the next version
                of ECMAscript is at the time of writting. The cool thing about ES.Next is that ES.Next features are finished proposals so viewers can in a way speculate about features that 
                may be arriving to the standard with the next release.

            <h1 class="title">Working With The Following Video</h1>
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeDP-rzOnAA">Build A Responsive Website With HTML & CSS Tutorial</a></p>
            <p>
              The video in the link above is pretty much what the link title says, it's a tutorial on bulding an interactive website step by step.
              what I found to be really cool is that the creator provides the viewers with all the files he uses in the video so if you want to, you
              can code along with him, which is exactly what I did and I will now discuss my experience in doing that.
            </p>
            <p>
              right off the bat I noticed his IDE he was using, which is Visula Studio Code. Personally that is my favorite IDE to use for web dev because of the vast 
              amount of plugins you can download to make your development experince seamless. proceeding through the video the first thing he got to that really caught my 
              eyes was when styling the header he used "display: flex;" to keep all items in a row within the header, that is something I am going to keep in mind while 
              styling web pages because that for me personally becomes forgotten. Moving on I also noticed the casing he was using for naming. In the video he was using kebab-case
              I haven tried using kebab-case, I normally use camelCase or PascalCase, but the thing is I noticed it was very easy to read the names of elements using 
              kebab-case, I might have to try it out.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout the video I started to see just how much he was using flex properties within CSS, this is something I personally started to gain an appreciation for because of
              how scalable those properties are. Following the video I was eager to dig deepeer into all the capabilites flex properties have to offer. This leads me to
              the next thing I noticed he was using which was the vh and vw units within CSS, I learned early on in developing web pages, that using proper units is key when it comes
              to responsivness.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next thing I found to be pretty spectacular was when he filled the intro-text with a gradient color using "-webkit-background-clip" and "webkit-text-fill-color" paired with
              a linear gradient. This comes out looking beautiful with that modern touch through the use of transparency. Continuing on another amazing tactic he used was when he was 
              styling the image of the laptop he used "filter: drop-shadow()" this was something I was completely unaware of and will definetly be adding to my tool kit after 
              I do a bit more research on it.

            <h1 class="title">Thoughts & Opinions</h1>
            <h5>After reading the following article <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/02/9-common-usability-blunders/">(Link Here)</a> here are a few of my thoughts and opinions.</h5>
            <br>
            <h6>Tiny Clickable Areas</h6>
            <p>
              This topic is major, I cannot even come close to explaing how aggravating a UI can be when the area you are suposed to be clicking is far to small or unrecognizable as 
              a clickable area, this can create a ton of problems for users and the entity deploying the website. First off from the user standpoint, it just looks really tacky. Any website
              that appears to be tacky to me, personally it makes me less inclined to dig deeper into content and lowers patience with the website. For the entity deploying the website
              it almost lowers their credibility to deploy quality designs and inturn lessens web traffic.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h6>Content That Is Difficult To Scan</h6>
            <p>
              Another topic that is very critical for quality web design, having cluttered content I have come to realize is just down right ineffective. after reading this article 
              it made me think of things in terms of how people view websites, they click a link, hoping to find the information they were searching for by scrolling through the page. 
              This is where setting the page up to be scanned easily is extremely important. If a user can't take a quick glimpse and see exactly what they are looking for
              they will not waste their time searching. That is why content placement is important and breaking up text can make or break a website.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h6>Old Permalinks Pointing Nowhere</h6>
            <p>
              "eww" is what I say to broken hyperlinks, this is a major no no for websites that in turn cause users to rethink the content they are taking in. From personal experience, any hyperlink
              that leads me to nowhere automatically makes me rethink my experience within the website. It almost makes me feel as if they rushed to deploy a website just to get it out there, or 
              its just old and outdated which makes me exit the website and search for a newer source of information or content.
            </p>

            <h1 class="title">Usability Issues</h1>
            <h5>After reading the following article <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/10/30-usability-issues-to-be-aware-of/">(Link Here)</a> here are a few of my thoughts and opinions.</h5>
            <br>
            <h6>3-Click-Rule</h6>
            <p>
              I agree with the 3-click-rule, users should not have to sift through a web page to find what they are looking for. everything should be conciseand easily navigated.
              This is where good use of navigation is key. Having solid naming conventions is key, taking the extra time to think of a good title can go a long way.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h6>2-Second-Rule</h6>
            <p>
              I find this very fascinating. While I do agree with it, sometimes preceived quickness can make up for going slightly over the two seconds they recommend in the article. This can be done with things like 
              dynamic loading screens that give users the feeling that their content is just about to arrive, in a way diverting their attention.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h6>Inverted Pyramid</h6>
            <p>
              Discussed in the article, they touch on the Inverted Pyramid writting style. "The inverted pyramid is a writing style where the summary of the
              article is presented in the beginning of the article." It is important to note the diffrences in wrttting conventionally compared to writting web
              content. Within traditional writting you wan to build up to a conclusion but thats where the diffrence becomoes apparent when writting content
              for a web page, you want to attract the readers attention and give them the satisfaction they came looking for.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h6>You don’t use pop-ups</h6>
            <p>
              This is something I agree with entirely, pop ups are annoying when they are unecessary. They take the attention away from the content search forcing
              the users to interact, which can make the user leave the page entirely... I've been there.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h6>You have at most one animation per page</h6>
            <p>
              This is something I feel is used with newer front end developers. When being exposed to all the animations a developer can use,
              it becoems very easy to become carried away. I have fallen victim to using more animations than "allowed." This actually draws the attention 
              away from the content you worked so hard with delivering.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h6>Banner-Blindness</h6>
            <p>
              Banner blindness is very important to tke note of. Having content crowded to the outter edges of the pages, in most cases gets looked past so 
              it is very important to limit banner content and in the case that you do display content in the outer areas of a web page to not over due it, for the reason
              that it may be over looked.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h6>Eye-Tracking</h6>
            <p>
              Eye-Tracking is something I find rather fascinating. with modern technology, it is now possibly to use tech similar to Tobii eye tracking 
              which is what they use in gaming computers to actually study users eye movment on different webpages to see exactly where and what they are 
              looking at. This can help with future development of web sites to cater to the data they find within studying users eye movment.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h6>Cliffhanger-Effect (Zeigarnik-Effect)</h6>
            <p>
              Mastering marketing. The cliffhanger-effect does that perfectly. I notice that some of the best social media platforms do this perfectly, noticeably
              with the page at the end of snapchat, with what everyone likes to call click bait. It lures users into what makes web pages that extra cash and that is through add 
              revenue with interaction. It's one thing to have adds on your webpage but its another to actually get users to interact with those adds.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h6>Satisficing</h6>
            <p>
              I notice myself as a user satisficng for what it "good enough" a lot of the time when i am trrying to prove a point I will enter my web search to sway 
              in my direction and then once the web pages load I can usually find one explicitly listing exactly what I am looking for in small detail, but it is good enough
              to get my point across. it suffices what im looking for and does the job.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h6>You don’t use too small font sizes</h6>
            <p>
              Small fonts in my eyes can be rendered useless in this day and age. There are far to many websites out there where users would much rather spend their 
              time rather than squinting trying to find information they may never be able to find. utilize headers appropriately and get those P tags sized perfectly
              on all platforms.

            <h1 class="title">All About Usability</h1>
            <h5>Thoughts on each of the features dicussed in the following article <a href="https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/principles-website-usability/">Link Here</a></h5>
            <br>
            <h6>Availability and Accessibility</h6>
            <p>
              I could not agree with this more. A site that is unreacheable or has things like broken links is aggravating. Everything nowadays is extremely fast placed 
              it's the standard of living now at least in the United States that is. Tech needs to work flawlessly and give users that 
              instant satisfaction they are looking for. Mobile responsivness is another extremely critical point to touch on. Most web browsing is done on users phones
              now, so it is importaant to develop with a mobile first approach.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h6>Clarity</h6>
            <p>
              I found this segment of the article very informative. What really grabbed my attention was the fact that they mentioned user familiaritiy and how 
              it's okay to look at other websites for inspiration. Personally whenever I start a web design project I like to browse the internet for beautifully crafted
              websites, these websites are proven designs that work and have worked through constant iterations and levels of perfecting.

            <h6>Learnability</h6>
            <p>
              This is something I enjoyed reading up on. It's interesting to think about the standards of web design. These are patterns that users pick up on that 
              can make learnign new websites rather quick. An example I can think of is online shopping sites. Users can enter a site for the first time and through 
              past experiences (given the website is set up to the standards) learn the site and navigate it first try. They can do things like add a item to their cart 
              followed by checking out their cart and proceeding through the transaction process. These things are easily learned through proper UI usage.

            <br>
            <h6>Credibility</h6>
            <p>
              Credibility is huge. You want visitors to trust what you have to offer, whether it be a service or content, if it's not credible
              users will discard what a site has to offer. From my experience presentation can boost credibility, when I am browsing the web, if a site looks quality, I think quality.
              This may not always be true but it's something to think about when constructing a meaningful website. Take the extra time to put an about page, introducing yourself or your
              company users respect that.

            <h6>Relevancy</h6>
            <p>
              Relevancy is major. After reading the article, they discuss the importance of thinking about the users that will be visiting a site and also the purpose someone may be visiting a site.
              when developing a website put yourself in the users shoes, as they talk about in the article plan out scenarios that a user may be faced with, traverse the website as if you are the user 
              see if content can be easily found or seen, and more importantly relevant to their visit.

            <h1>Microservices vs Monolithic Architecture</h1>
            <p>
              Monolithic Architecture is set up for traditional server side systems. The entire system's function is based on a single application. This type of Architecture
              comes with some advatages the first being that it is rather fast to develop, an application can be developed with basic features and then scaled up over time.
              Monolithic apps can in some cases be faster than microservice apps because they do not have the need to communicate with various APIs. Every piece of software within 
              a Monolithic system all communicate with the same Database and are located on the same server, they also will use the same file system. Monolithic applications
              in the long run can become difficult in maintaining because of their tightly coupled processes, where making a single change can create a domino effect causing
              problems throughout the entire application.  
            </p>
            <p>
              Microservice Architecture is an Architecture where every feature is it's own application. Things like authentification and posting are their own application
              on their own server but are connected through the use of APIs. connecting seperate applications in general is preformed through the use of JSON API based applications.
              Microservices are not nearly as tightly coupled as Monolithic applications, each services is not dependent on one another so making a single change wouldn't 
              effect the other services because they are standalone. One of the major advatages of Microservices is their scalability, you can scale up individual componets
              instead of having to scale up the application as a whole. Since each component can function without the other, if one compnent fails the others don't.

            <h5><a href="https://www.zachleat.com/web/mitt-romney-webfont-problem/">THE MITT ROMNEY WEB FONT PROBLEM</a></h5>
            <br>
            <p>
              The problem here is that multiple font weights and styles of the same typeface were used together so in the case of the 
              mitt romney webfont problem the word "not" was italicized so that when the web page was loading the flash of invisble text was in 
              the place of the word not making the headline read "Mitt Romney is officially running for president." This created a lot of 
              probles when reading the article for the text outside the italicized text was displayed before the italicized text making readers
              beleive that Mitt Romney was officially running for president when infact he wasn't.
            </p>
            <p>
              This problem can create confusion across a multitude of cases. One word can make a major diffrence in headlines and within text. 
              failing at delivering proper information can cause credibility to diminish within a few views. All it take is for 
              a developer to inappropriately apply a font and then the real issues happen when the mal practice gets noticed and 
              captured by a user.
            </p>
            <p>
              This can all be fixed in my personal opinion by testing a font out on multiple browsers. If there is a font and a case that 
              must be used developers should take the steps to make sure that the font delivery doesn't run into discrepancies. Developer can 
              eliminate the FOIT and switch it to a fallback font that loads while the selected font is loading. Also you can group your fonts 
              so they load in a single repaint. One last way to get around this problem is through utilizing font-synthesis to show browser generated bold 
              and italic fallbacks while the real web fonts load.

              <h1>Nodejs and the V8 Javascritpt Engine</h1>
              <p>
                Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. Node.js runs the V8 Engine.
                The V8 Engine is a powerful open source Javascript engine provided by Google. Now what exactly is a Javascript Engine? It is software that converts
                Javascript code into lower level or machine code that microprocessors can understand. This is essential to make sure that Javascript
                runs the same way acrosss multiple devices within diffrent browsers. 
              </p>
              <p>
                In this segement we are focusing on the V8 Javascript engine that is used within google chrome, but there are more than just
                the v8 Engine there are many for diffrent browsers. For example there are the Rhino, JavaScriptCore, and spider monkey. All of 
                these engines follow the EchmaScript standards as discussed before, the EchmaScript standards define how the language should work 
                and what features it should have.  
              </p>
              <p>
                The V8 Engine is written in in C++ and used within Chrome and Nodejs. What is cool is that the V8 Engine can run 
                standalone within our own C++ program. What that means is we can use our own function implementation in C++ to add 
                new features to Javascript. This creates a vast amount of flexibility, paired with unrivaled usability within JavaScript.
                I find the ability to create new JavaScript functionality extremely fascinating, this in its self helps propels web development 
                into the future.
